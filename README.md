Hangman
IM NOT GOOD WITH GIT SO I DONT KNOW IF YOU CAN ADD STUFF HERE
BUT IF YOU CAN, MAKE EDITS AND ADD MORE TO THE "TO DO" LIST IF YOU COME UP WITH IDEAS.

To do:
Add word choice randomizer
  - Some sort of dictionary
  - Maybe an API

Add game elements
  - Lives
    - Repeating the same letter should not decrease lives
    - Dependant on string size?
    - Display correct answer if failed
  - Something like "welcome to hangman" at the start?
